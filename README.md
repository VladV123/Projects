# Vlad Voiculescu - Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am an engineer with a strong background in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Hardware Verification, currently expanding my expertise in **Cloud Engineering & Network Infrastructure**. 

Below you will find a curated list of my technical projects, categorized by domain.

---

## Cloud & Network Infrastructure
* **Secure Remote Access & Network Infrastructure (Home Lab)**
  * **Tech Stack:** OpenVPN, Gigabit Router (Asus), DHCP, RDP, Zero Trust Security.
  * **Description:** Designed and implemented a secure, encrypted VPN tunnel for remote access. Configured DHCP Static IP Reservations and restricted Remote Desktop (RDP) access exclusively through the VPN to eliminate public port exposure. Includes architectural diagrams and setup documentation.

## Machine Learning & Data Science
* **Summary Scoring Model using BERT**
  * **Tech Stack:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers (BERT), PyTorch/TensorFlow.
  * **Description:** Built a summary evaluation model using the BERT transformer architecture to assign quality scores to text summaries.

* **Collaborative Movie Recommendation System**
  * **Tech Stack:** Python, Neural Networks, Collaborative Filtering, Cosine Similarity.
  * **Description:** Developed a personalized recommendation engine with a web interface, utilizing user/movie embeddings and addressing the cold-start problem.

* **Drone Detection in Static Video Backgrounds**
  * **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, CNNs.
  * **Description:** Bachelor thesis project focused on detecting moving drones using Convolutional Neural Networks and classical image processing filters.

* **Spam Detection System**
  * **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn (Decision Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes).
  * **Description:** Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models for spam classification using a Kaggle dataset.
